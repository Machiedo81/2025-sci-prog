# Znanstveno programiranje - Scientific Programming

**Course:** Znanstveno programiranje (Scientific Programming)
**Course Code:** PMID16
**Year:** 1
**Instructor:** Nikola BaliÄ‡
**University:** Faculty of Science, University of Split
**Credits:** 8 ECTS

## Course Description

This course focuses on using computers as tools for process automation and creating large, fast, and scalable solutions using complex algorithms. It covers visualization, data and code management as integral parts of scientific programming, with special emphasis on integration and multiprocessing for analyzing large quantities of numerical data.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

1. Apply appropriate data structures and algorithms for given problems
2. Apply paradigms specific to parallel/functional programming
3. Visualize results and report findings through code
4. Apply numerical libraries for solving algebraic and statistical problems
5. Analyze algorithm complexity
6. Organize programs into functions and modules
7. Understand the internal structure of operating systems and their kernels
8. Write scripts for execution in the operating system kernel
